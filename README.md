INTRODUCTION

After having carried out an investigation on some prediction models used in the evaluation of
characteristics and taxes to validate possible people with heart diseases, we find ourselves
with a process of data analysis and univariate exploration which is necessary to undertake if
we want an accuracy of the tall model.
During the data evaluation process, an exploratory analysis of quantitative and qualitative
variables had to be carried out to find out which of these were the most appropriate in the
development of the model. I consider that this is the key process if we want to obtain a model
in accordance with the final actual results. After this, it was necessary to start with the
development of decision trees using each of the variables (qualitative and quantitative) to
generate predictions, this was carried out with parameters that range from adjusting the exact
number of levels for each tree to the minimum number of branches allowed, raising accuracy
percentages up to 90%.
With this we learned how to generate a decision tree taking into account variations that allow
us to give ourselves sufficient criteria to choose the best model. In addition to this, a random
forest was generated to validate the percentage of importance of each of the attributes,
running up to 100 models that vary in the number of parameters. I consider that up to this point
my contribution has been significant in terms of the depth of the evaluation that I have made
in the various models as decision trees and in the choice of attributes and variables. Now in
this work I undertake the search for the best predictive model which can generate results with
a low level of error, this is done by applying several predictive models and making an
evaluation between them.
